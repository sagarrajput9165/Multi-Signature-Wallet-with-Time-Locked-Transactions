# Multi-Signature-Wallet-with-Time-Locked-Transactions


## Project Description

A secure smart contract implementation for the Stacks blockchain that combines multi-signature authorization with time-locked transaction execution. This contract ensures that high-value transactions require multiple approvals and cannot be executed immediately, providing an additional layer of security against unauthorized or hasty financial decisions.

## Project Vision

To create a robust, enterprise-grade wallet solution that protects digital assets through collaborative decision-making and time-based security mechanisms. Our vision is to make cryptocurrency management safer for organizations, DAOs, and security-conscious individuals by requiring consensus and enforcing cooling-off periods for all transactions.

## Key Features

### Multi-Signature Authorization
- Requires multiple authorized signers to approve transactions
- Configurable signature threshold (default: 2 signatures required)
- Prevents single points of failure in fund management

### Time-Lock Security
- Enforces a mandatory waiting period before transaction execution
- Default 24-hour delay (~144 blocks) provides protection against rushed decisions
- Gives signers time to review and potentially cancel malicious transactions

### Simple Transaction Flow
- **Propose**: Any authorized signer can propose a new transaction
- **Sign**: Multiple signers must approve the proposed transaction
- **Execute**: After sufficient signatures and time delay, transaction can be executed

### Access Control
- Owner-managed authorization system
- Only authorized principals can propose and sign transactions
- Transparent signature tracking for audit purposes

## Future Scope

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- **Dynamic Signature Requirements**: Adjust required signatures based on transaction amount
- **Emergency Cancel**: Allow signers to cancel pending transactions
- **Signer Management**: Add/remove authorized signers through governance
- **Multiple Token Support**: Extend beyond STX to support SIP-010 tokens

### Phase 3 Advanced Features
- **Hierarchical Permissions**: Different permission levels for different transaction types
- **Recurring Transactions**: Support for scheduled, recurring payments
- **Integration APIs**: Web interface and mobile app integration
- **Advanced Timelock**: Variable time delays based on transaction amount or type

### Enterprise Features
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive transaction history and signature tracking
- **Compliance Tools**: Regulatory reporting and compliance checking
- **Multi-Wallet Management**: Manage multiple wallets from single interface
- **Integration with DeFi**: Direct integration with DeFi protocols and DEXs
